## Recent Update

As of release 5.6.0, Beta and Developer Preview products are now exposed via
the main `twilio-python` artifact. Releases of the `alpha` branch have been
discontinued.

If you were using the `alpha` release line, you should be able to switch back
to the normal release line without issue.

If you were using the normal release line, you should now see several new
product lines that were historically hidden from you due to their Beta or
Developer Preview status. Such products are explicitly documented as
Beta/Developer Preview both in the Twilio docs and console, as well as through
in-line code documentation here in the library.

# Twilio REST API and TwiML Libraries for .NET

Twilio provides a simple HTTP-based API for sending and receiving phone calls and text messages. Learn more at [http://www.twilio.com][0]

### Adding Twilio libraries to your .NET project

The best and easiest way to add the Twilio libraries to your .NET project is to use the NuGet package manager.

#### With Visual Studio IDE

From within Visual Studio, you can use the NuGet GUI to search for and install the Twilio NuGet package. Or, as a shortcut, simply type the following command into the Package Manager Console:

    Install-Package Twilio

#### With .NET Core Command Line Tools

If you are building with the .NET Core command line tools, then you can run the following command from within your project directory:

    dotnet add package Twilio

### Sample Usage

The examples below show how to have your application initiate and outbound phone call and send an SMS message using the Twilio .NET helper library:
```csharp
TwilioClient.Init("ACCOUNT_SID", "AUTH_TOKEN");

var call = CallResource.Create(
    new PhoneNumber("+11234567890"),
    from: new PhoneNumber("+10987654321"),
    url: new Uri("https://my.twiml.here")
);
Console.WriteLine(call.Sid);

var message = MessageResource.Create(
    new PhoneNumber("+11234567890"),
    from: new PhoneNumber("+10987654321"),
    body: "Hello World!"
);
Console.WriteLine(message.Sid);
```

### TwiML Generation
```csharp
var gather = new Gather(numDigits: 1, action: "hello-monkey-handle-key.cshtml", method: "POST")
    .Say("To speak to a real monkey, press 1. Press 2 to record your own monkey howl. Press any other key to start over.");

var response = new VoiceResponse()
    .Say("Hello Monkey")
    .Play("http://demo.twilio.com/hellomonkey/monkey.mp3")
    .Gather(gather);
Console.WriteLine(response);

/*
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Response>
  <Say>Hello Monkey</Say>
  <Play>http://demo.twilio.com/hellomonkey/monkey.mp3</Play>
  <Gather numDigits="1" action="hello-monkey-handle-key.cshtml" method="POST">
    <Say>To speak to a real monkey, press 1. Press 2 to record your own monkey howl. Press any other key to start over.</Say>
  </Gather>
</Response>
*/
```

## Migrating from earlier versions
See the migration guide [here][3]. Also, if you were using the Twilio.Mvc package, that has been replaced by the [Twilio.AspNet.Mvc][4]
package which is compatible with this version of the library.

## Alpha Version
The alpha version is no longer necessary. All Twilio products are available in the main-line library.

## Getting help

If you need help installing or using the library, please contact Twilio Support at help@twilio.com first. Twilio's Support staff are well-versed in all of the Twilio Helper Libraries, and usually reply within 24 hours.

If you've instead found a bug in the library or would like new features added, go ahead and open issues or pull requests against this repo!
